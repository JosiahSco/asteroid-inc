# Asteroid Inc.

Simple clicker game I'm making for fun. All game assets were masterfully drawn by me in MS-Paint. 

I plan to work on some more animations/graphics and a few more features to make the game more interesting.

Progress is saved to localStorage on the browser. If you have progress saved before a large update is made, you may need to use the reset button to correct storage values.

## TODO
Add random events, mini asteroid flies across screen that can be clicked for bonus credits   
Better balance of prestiging and late game  
Add more achievements  
Add more miner types
